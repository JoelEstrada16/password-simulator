# password-simulator

## Description
    I found this project really challenging at first, I went at it all wrong and put myself through unnecessary stress when the answer was so simple.
    I was console logging it all and figured i was doing it right but others example in the class made me realize how wrong I really was. I put every option into a function when all I had to do was put alot of else if statements like it was the rock paper scissors game. I was also not putting my variable globally at first I kept putting it locally which caused ton of problems. Always a good thing to look back at old classroom recording and always good to take advice from others and look at others work online to and see how they managed to execute their code.
